Euro-trip Live(ish\*)blog
=========================

`My`_ little liveblog / travelblog thing, covering everything 
leading up to and including my trip to Amsterdam and Prague to 
speak at `Write the Docs - Europe`_.

Please excuse the spelling errors, English is only my frist 
language.

Oldest posts are at the bottom, newer posts are at the top.

\* live-ish = gets updated about once a day. Don't expect 
real-time updates; it's a miracle when I remember to update my 
Facebook, this real-ish-time blogging is a learning process for me.
