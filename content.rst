Euro-trip Well-After-The-Fact Blog
==================================

`My`_ little liveblog / travelblog thing, covering everything 
leading up to and including my trip to Amsterdam and Prague to 
speak at `Write the Docs - Europe`_.

Please excuse the spelling errors, English is only my first 
language.

Oldest posts are at the bottom, newer posts are at the top.

\* Well-After-The-Fact = It was originally a liveblog, then a live(ish) blog,
then I took two weeks off to write the last three days worth of posts --
basically I'm just glad I was able to stick with it to the end, even if it was
a bit delayed getting finished.

.. note::

    Posts for this liveblog have ceased. Keep an eye out for my next trip when
    I will try my hand at live-blogging again :)
